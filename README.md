  The **statr** package offers a SAS®-like interface to R statistics.
The package has two primary purposes: default statistics options to match
SAS® outputs, and provide function calls that resemble those found in SAS®.
This approach will make it much easier for users to replace SAS® programs 
with R programs, when desired, and make it easier for SAS® programmers
to learn R.
