Title: Provides a SAS®-like interface to R statistical functions
Version: 0.0.9000
Author: Kevin Kramer
Maintainer: Kevin Kramer <kevin.kramer@experis.com>
Description: Contains functions that provide a SAS®-like interface to R 
    statistics. The package has two primary purposes: default statistics 
    options to match SAS® outputs, and provide function calls that resemble 
    those found in SAS®. This approach will make it much easier for users to 
    replace SAS® programs with R programs, when desired, and make it easier 
    for SAS® programmers to learn R.
